# emergex Benchmark Suite

> 39 execution-graded benchmarks that test AI coding agents on real freelance work — not LeetCode, not HumanEval. Actual $500-$1,500 tasks across 15 professional domains.

## How It Works

Every benchmark follows the same loop:

1. **Prompt** — a real-world task spec (auth system, financial engine, SEO audit, etc.)
2. **Generate** — an AI model produces TypeScript code
3. **Execute** — code runs against `bun:test` suites with real assertions
4. **Grade** — 70% execution score + 30% keyword coverage

No human evaluation. No subjective scoring. Code runs or it doesn't.

### Autoresearch Loop

The harness runs iteratively:

```
Run all benchmarks → Analyze failures → Mutate system prompt → Re-run
```

Each iteration generates targeted mutations from failed benchmarks (e.g., "always implement topological sort for DAG resolution"). These compound across iterations — scores improve automatically.

### Temperature Sweep

Each benchmark runs at 3 temperatures (0.3, 0.5, 0.7). Best result is kept. This matters — the same model can score 43 at temp=0.3 and 92 at temp=0.7.

| BT005 | State Machine | 92 | — | PASS |
| BT006 | Financial Dashboard | 54 | — | Improving |
| BT007 | SEO Audit | 96 | — | PASS |
| BT008 | Email Campaign | 54 | — | Improving |
| BT009 | CI/CD Pipeline | 33 | — | Improving |
| BT010 | Design Tokens | 39 | — | Improving |
| BT011 | Video Production | **100** | — | PERFECT |
| BT012 | Music Theory | 81 | — | PASS |
| BT013 | Data Visualization | 30 | — | Improving |
| BT014 | AI Consulting | 95 | — | PASS |
| BT015 | Security Audit | 30 | — | Improving |

**Iteration 1:** Average 69, 8/15 passing (>=80)
**Mutations generated:** 12 targeted learnings from failures

### Key Findings

1. **Knowledge vs Execution gap** — models score 100% on keywords but 0% on execution for complex tasks. They know every pattern but can't produce coordinated code that runs.

2. **Temperature matters** — same model scores 43 at temp=0.3 and 92 at temp=0.7 on the same benchmark. Always sweep.

3. **Mutations compound** — BT001 went 85→94 after one round of mutations. The system learns from its own failures.

4. **Multi-model fallback works** — devstral scored 100 on BT003 when qwen3.5 timed out. Different models excel at different domains.

## Grading System

Each benchmark produces a combined score:

- **Execution (70%)** — code is written to a temp file, test suite runs via `bun:test`. Score = passed/total assertions.
- **Keyword (30%)** — checks for domain-specific patterns in the output (e.g., "topological sort", "JWT", "NPV").
- **Combined** — `0.7 * exec + 0.3 * keyword`, clamped to 0-100.

If execution fails entirely (code won't compile), falls back to keyword-only scoring.
