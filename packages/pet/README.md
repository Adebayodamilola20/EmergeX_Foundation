# @emergex/pet - Companion System

Every emergex session spawns a unique companion. Your collection is your coding history.

## Quick Start

```bash
# In the TUI
/pet start      # Spawn dock companion + show card
/pet stop       # Dismiss
/pet deck       # View your collection
/pet card       # Roll a new card

# Standalone
bun run packages/pet/companion.ts        # Generate 5 random companions
bun run packages/pet/companion.ts deck   # View your deck
bun run packages/pet/terminal-pet.ts     # Terminal pet mode
```

## How It Works

1. Session starts - companion generated from seeded RNG (session ID as seed)
2. Species, element, title, accessory, stats, rarity all rolled
3. Companion registered in `~/.emergex/companion-deck.json`
4. On macOS, dock pet spawns with companion's name and colors
5. Session ends - summary attached to that companion's deck entry

Same session ID always produces the same companion (deterministic).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `companion.ts` | Companion generator, deck collection, seeded RNG |
| `terminal-pet.ts` | ANSI terminal pet renderer (cross-platform) |
| `PetWidget.tsx` | Ink (React CLI) component for TUI embedding |
| `package.json` | Package metadata (@emergex/pet) |

## Deck Storage

`~/.emergex/companion-deck.json` - persistent collection across sessions.

Each entry stores:
- Companion identity (species, element, title, accessory, rarity, shiny, stats, palette)
- Session metadata (start/end time, cwd, model, summary, tool calls, tokens)

## Dock Pet Bridge (macOS)

`/pet start` writes `~/.emergex/active-companion.json` with the companion's palette and name. The Swift dock pet (`apps/lil-emergex/`) reads this on launch to set its name label and color tint.

## Future: NFT Minting

Companions are designed to be mintable as on-chain SVG NFTs on Base (Coinbase L2). See `docs/COMPANION-NFT-STRATEGY.md` for the full plan.
